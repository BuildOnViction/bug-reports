### Guidelines
A bug or new feature report must follow the process to be considered for reward:

- Create an issue on TomoChain Github Bug Reports Repository: https://github.com/tomochain/bug-reports. Please include your TomoWallet address in the report.
- You should report the issue in as detailed as possible with reproducible steps (Please attach all supporting files (e.g. video, screenshots, configuration files, data files, output files, etc.). If the report is not detailed enough to reproduce the issue, the finder will not be eligible for rewards.
- If you propose a new feature, please explain why we need that feature and how it makes our products better.
- A proposal(s) to address or fix the issue is highly recommended. This could be a design proposal or include actual fix(es) to software code.
- Issues already submitted by another user or already known to the TomoChain team are not eligible for bounty rewards.
- Kindly note that any issue found and made public in any way forfeits the finder's right to the bounty.
- Multiple bugs caused by one underlying issue will be awarded one bounty.
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service. Only interact with accounts you own or with the explicit permission of the account holder.

We will make the best effort to meet the following response targets:
- Time to first response (from report submission): 2 business days.
- Time to confirmation (from report submission to issue confirmation): 2 business days. 200 TOMO will be distributed within 1 business day following issue confirmation.
